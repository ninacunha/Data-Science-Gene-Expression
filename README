# Predicting Tumor Malignancy Using Machine Learning

## Overview
This project applies machine learning models to predict whether a tumor is **benign or malignant** using diagnostic features from a breast cancer dataset. The notebook includes data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, feature selection, model training, and evaluation using multiple classification algorithms.

---

## Dataset
The dataset was obtained from Kaggle and contains numerical features describing tumor cell characteristics.  
Target variable:  
- **1 = Malignant**  
- **0 = Benign**


## Models Used
### **Logistic Regression**
- Evaluated with accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score  
- Provided baseline performance  

### **Decision Tree**
- Explored depth and node-splitting behavior  
- Compared overfitting vs. generalization  

### **K-Nearest Neighbors**
- Tested various k-values  
- Selected optimal k = 6  
- Used top 5 features for improved performance

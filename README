# Tumor Malignancy Prediction — Machine Learning Project
📌 Overview
This project uses machine learning techniques to predict whether a tumor is benign or malignant using diagnostic features from breast cancer cell samples. The notebook includes data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, model training, performance evaluation, and insights into feature importance.

# 🩺 Dataset

The project uses a breast cancer diagnostic dataset (commonly the Breast Cancer Wisconsin Dataset).
Typical features include:

Mean radius

Texture

Smoothness

Compactness

Symmetry

Fractal dimension
…and more feature derivatives.

Target variable:

0 = Benign

1 = Malignant
